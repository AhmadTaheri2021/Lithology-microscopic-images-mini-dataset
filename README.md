### DATASET GENERATION AND PRE-PROCESSING
In this study, a mini dataset of lithology microscopic images is generated for both multi-class and binary classification task. In the following, the process of producing the mini dataset is described in detail and step by step.
### Lithology Microscopic Images description  
This study was performed in an oil carbonate reservoir in the Southern Persian Gulf, and â€¦ core samples from 2905 meters to 3101 meters were used. Core studies provide an array of useful information on petrophysical features of the study area. The hydrocarbon formation studied comprises mainly oil and water without gas. More investigations show that the average porosity and permeability in the studied zone are X % and Y (millidarcy) MD, respectively. The study of thin sections shows that there are three main lithologies, including Argillaceous Limestone, Limestone, and Dolomite, as shown in Fig. 1. Argillaceous Limestone is a type of sedimentary rock that includes a significant amount (but less than 50%) of clay comprising kaolinite, montmorillonite, illite, and chlorite. Limestone is another sedimentary rock that is largely comprised of calcium carbonate (CaCO3), typically in the form of calcite or aragonite. Dolomite, widely recognized as Dolostone, is a sedimentary carbonate rock rich in CaMg (CO3)2. The lithology column effectively shows the intervals of rocks and how they are placed versus depth, which gives a better understanding of the studied area. In this study, we provided a lithology column after scrutinizing cores and microscopic images in the laboratory in the RB well. Regarding Fig. 1, Argillaceous Limestone is responsible for the most significant share of lithology; however, the contributions of Dolomite and Limestone are almost the same.

### Data augmentation 
Generally, the performance of most ML models, DNN in particular, depends on the quality, quantity, and relevancy of training data samples to tackle the overfitting challenge and improve the model generalization [7]. However, labeled data for real-world applications may be limited in practice because collecting data might be time-consuming and costly in many project cases. In these cases, data augmentation techniques have become an important part of successful DL application on image data to enhance the diversity and sufficiency of training data set efficiently. [1] [7].

Data augmentation enhances the robustness of machine learning models by employing a wide range of techniques to increase the amount of data by generating artificially new data samples that the model might see in the real world based on existing samples. It includes making small changes to data or using DL models to generate new data points [1].
As augmented datasets can significantly decrease the generalization of an ML model, it is essential to conduct controlled experiments to evaluate the performance of the model trained with such datasets [7]. Therefore, in order to split a dataset into train and test sets and perform controlled experiments, we select image samples for the test set Manually. In this way, approximately about 20 percent of image samples (440 samples) are selected as the test set, and 80 percent of image samples (1687 samples) are selected for the train set.
In our study, different data augmentation methods are applied to original image samples; specifically, methods such as flipping, scaling, cropping, segmentation, and rotation. In this way, we divide each original image into six segmentations (sub-images), as shown in Fig. (2), then the process of data augmentation is conducted to generate new samples. In addition, as our original image sample classes are imbalanced, we use augmentation techniques to solve these issues in our dataset by applying different augmentation rates for different classes. Fig. 2 and Table 2, show our dataset's statistical information about the data distribution.
