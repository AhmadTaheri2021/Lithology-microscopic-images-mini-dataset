Argillaceous Limestone is a type of sedimentary rock that includes a significant amount (but less than 50%) of clay comprising kaolinite, montmorillonite, illite, and chlorite. Limestone is another sedimentary rock that would be largely comprised of calcium carbonate (CaCO3), typically in the form of calcite or aragonite. Dolomite, also widely recognized as Dolostone, is a sedimentary carbonate rock rich in CaMg (CO3)2. The lithology column effectively shows the intervals of rocks and how they are placed versus depth, which gives a better understanding of the studied area. In this study, we provided a lithology column after scrutinizing cores and microscopic images in the laboratory in the RB well. Regarding Fig. 1, Argillaceous Limestone is responsible for the most significant share of lithology; however, the contributions of Dolomite and Limestone are almost the same.
